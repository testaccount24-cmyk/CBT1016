TSO is a line mode command processor to resolve a problem that
causes difficulties with many TSO ternminal operators.  In ISPF,
a TSO terminal operator can execute a regular TSO line mode
command by typing TSO command in the Command area in many ISPF
panels.  All to often this extends to entering commands at the
TSO READY prompt and results in the COMMAND TSO NOT FOUND
message.  About all the TSO terminal operator can do is curse and
retype the command without the TSO.

The TSO command "cures" this problem.  It forms a proper command
line without the TSO command and uses the STACK service to queue
the command.  TSO does not execute the command directly; it
just prepares the Terminal Monitor Program to run the command
after TSO terminates.  The command can be an authorized command
validated using standard TSO facilities.

The batch JCL or TSO commands that follow prepare the TSO command
in a data set named userid.TSO.LOAD.  In order to add the command
to an existing data set, remove the PREP step or DELETE command
in the TSO commands, and alter the SYSLMOD DD statement in the
LINK step, or the LOAD parameter in the LINK TSO command.  Data
set hlq.TSO.CBT.PDS refers to this daa set.

Batch -
//PREP    EXEC PGM=IEFBR14
//SYSLMOD  DD  DISP=(MOD,DELETE),UNIT=SYSALLDA,SPACE=(TRK,0),
//             DSN=&SYSUID...TSO.LOAD
//LINK    EXEC PGM=IEWL,PARM='MAP,LIST,RENT,REFR,REUS'
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//SYSLMOD  DD  DISP=(NEW,CATLG),UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(TRK,(1,1,1)),
//             DSN=*.PREP.SYSLMOD
//SYSLIN   DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=hlq.TSO.CBT.PDS(OBJECT)
//         DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=hlq.TSO.CBT.PDS(LINK)

TSO -
DELETE LMATTR.LOAD
LINK ('hlq.TSO.CBT.PDS(OBJECT)' 'hlq.TSO.CBT.PDS(LINK)') RENT REFR REUS
LOAD(LMATTR)

You can enter the LINK command as one long string in most
environments, including the READY prompt or ISPF option 6 (ISPF
Command Shell).

First. using the TSO TSOLIB command make the userid.TSO.LOAD data set
available to TSO -

TSOLIB ACTIVATE DATASET(TSO.LOAD)

Then enter

TSO TSO COMMAND

You can install the TSO command in any convenient library in your
link list, or into LPA.  The command processor is AMODE 31, RMODE
ANY, so it will load above the 16meg line and not affect your
below the line storage.
