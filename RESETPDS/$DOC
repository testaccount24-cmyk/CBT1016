The RESETPDS line mode TSO command effectively deletes all
members of a partitioned data set and arranges the data set
attributes so the next member added to the data set follows the
directory.

Command syntax -
  RESETPDS/RPDS  'dslist'  SHARE/SHR  VERSION

  Required - 'dslist'
  Defaults - None

  'dslist' - One or more data set names of PDS or PDSE data sets
             to reset
  SHARE/SHR - Allocate the data sets in dslist with the SHR
             allocation attribute.  SHARE cannot be used with
             PDSE data sets.
  VERSION - Print the RPDS005I message containing the version of
            the command.

            C O N T E N T S   O F   T H I S   D A T A   S E T

Member
$DOC     - This member
OBJECT   - The object "deck" followed by the Binder control
           statements used to prepare the RESETPDS load module.
RESETPDS - Copy the RESETPDS member and its alias RPDS to
           your SYS1.HELP data set
SOURCE   - The Assembler source for RESETPDS.

P R E P A R I N G   T H E   R E S E T P D S / R P D S   L O A D   M O D

The JCL or TSO statements prepare a userid.RESETPDS.LOAD data
set.  hlq.RESETPDS.CBT.PDS represents this data set.

Batch -

//PREP    EXEC PGM=IEFBR14
//SYSLMOD  DD  DISP=(MOD,DEETE),UNIT=SYSALLDA,SPACE=(TRK,0),
//             DSN=&SYSUID..RESETPDS.LOAD
//LINK    EXEC PGM=IEWL,PARM='MAP,XREF,LIST,RENT,REFR,REUS'
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//SYSLMOD  DD  DISP=(NEW,CATLG),UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(TRK,(1,1,1)),
//             DSN=*.PREP.SYSLMOD
//SYSLIN   DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=hlq.RESETPDS.CBT.PDS(OBJECT)

TSO -

DELETE RESETPDS.LOAD
LINK 'hlq.RESETPDS.CBT.PDS(OBJECT)' LOAD(RESETPDS) RENT REFR REUS

If you prefer to link RESETPDS into a data set that has other
members, remove the PREP step in the batch JCL and alter the DD
statement with DD name SYSLMOD in the LINK step to meet your
requirements.  In TSO, remove the DELETE command, and alter the
LOAD operand in the LINK command to meet your requirements.

Use the TSOLIB command or whatever similar facility is available
in your environment, and then try running the command.

TSOLIB ACT DATASET(RESETPDS.LOAD)
RESETPDS ...

RESETPDS can be installed in any convenient LINKLIST library, or
in LPA or MLPA.  It is small, less than 4K, and is RMODE ANY.
