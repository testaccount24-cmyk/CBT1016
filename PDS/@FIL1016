//*     This data set contains a mashup of Steve Myers' TSO         *   FILE1016
//*     commands.  Each command is packaged as an unloaded PDS;     *   FILE1016
//*     retrieve the PDS using the RECEIVE command, for example:    *   FILE1016
//*                                                                 *   FILE1016

//*     Note:  The latest versions of the REVIEW TSO command        *   FILE1016
//*            (File 134 - source, File 135 - load), if later       *   FILE1016

//*            file.  Just REVIEW the file, and all the members     *   FILE1016
//*            will be expanded.  This will speed up the process    *   FILE1016

//*     Each PDS has more detailed documentation about the          *   FILE1016
//*     command and how to prepare, install and use the command.    *   FILE1016

//*     The default name of the PDS allocated by the RECEIVE        *   FILE1016
//*     command is userid.command.CBT.PDS.  If possible, use        *   FILE1016
//*     this name as it will make preparation of the command        *   FILE1016
//*     easier as the data set name will match the data set         *   FILE1016

//*                IEHLIST LISTPDS command without requiring the    *   FILE1016
//*                the difficult JCL setup and the                  *   FILE1016

//*     XI       - A command that permits several TSO commands      *   FILE1016
//*                to be stacked on one line.  The original idea    *   FILE1016
//*                for XI was PCF, a long forgotten TSO add on.     *   FILE1016
//*                More often than not, PCF command stacking        *   FILE1016
//*                simply did not seem to work.  It is a viable     *   FILE1016
//*                alternate to using the "Field Mark" key on       *   FILE1016
//*                real 3270 terminals, but its use has declined    *   FILE1016
//*                as most 3270 emulators do not seem to provide    *   FILE1016
//*                the "Field Mark" key, require multiple key       *   FILE1016
//*                presses to enter a "Field Mark," or change       *   FILE1016
//*                what a terminal operator must enter to enter     *   FILE1016
//*                a "Field Mark" from release to release of the    *   FILE1016
