This data set contains a mashup of Steve Myers' TSO commands.
Each command is packaged as an unloaded PDS; retrieve the PDS
using the RECEIVE command, for example:

RECEIVE INDATASET('hlq.TSOCMND.CBT.PDS(DSSTAT)')

Each PDS has more detailed documentation about the command and
how to prepare, install and use the command.

The default name of the PDS allocated by the RECEIVE command is
userid.command.CBT.PDS.  If possible, use this name as it will
make preparation of the command easier as the data set name will
match the data set name used in the documentation.

$DOC     - This member
ALLOCVOL - ALLOCVOL simulates a volume definition DD statement
           used by some IBM batch utilities.
DSSTAT   - A command loosely modeled on the IBM LISTDS command, but
           with more detailed, and in my opinion, useful output.
FINDCMD  - TSO command to report the library where a TSO command,
           or any binary program, can be found.
           findcmd asma90
            ASMA90 IN LINKLIST ASM.SASMMOD1
            READY
           findcmd iefactrt
            IEFACTRT IN MLPA
            READY
FREESYS  - TSO command to free all SYSnnnnn nallocations, where
           nnnnn is 5 numerics.
IDUMP    - TSO command to create an image dump of one or more
           tracks of a data set.
INVCP    - TSO command to run a program in the link list or a
           private library as a TSO command.  With the TSOLIB TSO
           command, the need for something like INVCP is limited.
KEEPITUP - A TSO command processor to keep your TSO session
           active with no terminal activity.  It periodically
           updates your screen with the current date & time and
           the time your session has been active.  Many installations
           discourage or forbid the use of a tool like this;
           verify it is OK with your management before using KEEPITUP.
LISTTSOU - List TSO users currently logged on.
           listtsou asid
            THE FOLLOWING TSO USERS ARE CURRENTLY ACTIVE -
             BENMAR(X'003E') SMYERS(X'002D')
LMATTR   - List a simplified module map of load modules.
LOGTIMED - List logon information about your TSO session.
RESETPDS - Delete all members of a PDS or PDSE, and arrange a
           PDS so the next member added to the data set
           immediately follows the directory.
TIOT     - A TSO command to list the TIOT for your TSO session.
           A useful enhancement is TIOT lists the current EXCP
           count for each DD statement.
           tiot f(sys0)
            SMYERS QCBTPROC QCBTPROC
            SYS00047 5103 CBT004 10 SMYERS.LOAD
           The 10 between the volume serial and data set name is the
           current EXCP count for the DD.  This is not as useful
           as one might expect as z/OS frequently resets these
           counters.
TSO      - A command that will execute the command string that
           follows the TSO command.  TSO is a convenience for
           TSO users accustomed to entering TSO command on an
           ISPF Command line when in TSO READY.
TSOLPDIR - (alias LISTPDS) A TSO command to list PDS directory
           entries.  When run in TSO in batch, TSOLPDIR is a
           useful replacement for the IEHLIST LISTPDS command
           without requiring the the difficult JCL setup and the
           VOL=device-type=VVVVVV parameter on the LISTPDS command.
XI       - A command that permits several TSO commands to be
           stacked on one line.  The original idea for XI was
           PCF, a long forgotten TSO add on.   More often than not,
           PCF command stacking simply did not seem to work.  It is a
           viable alternate to using the "Field Mark" key on real
           3270 terminals, but its use has declined as most 3270
           emulators do not seem to provide the "Field Mark"
           key, require multiple key presses to enter a "Field
           Mark," or change what a terminal operator must enter to
           enter a "Field Mark" from release to release of
           the terminal emulator.
