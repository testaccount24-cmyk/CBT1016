The XI TSO command (and its related aliases, XIN and XINP)
provide a TSO command line user a means to enter several TSO
commands on a single TSO command line.  For example -

xi dsstat xi.cbt.pds\listd xi.cbt.pds
 dsstat xi.cbt.pds
 SMYERS.XI.CBT.PDS
 --UNIT---DEVICE---VOLUME--RECFM--LRECL--BLKSIZE--DSORG--ALLOCATED--USED

The original inspiration for XI was PCF.  Among its many alleged
features was command stacking, but, sadly, there were problems -

 - Frequently, it didn't work.
 - It interfered with the one command stacking feature in base
   TSO: the AT subcommand in TSO TEST permits TSO TEST subcommands
   to be stacked using the ; character as the delimiter:
   AT ... (command;command;...)
   With PCF installed, since PCF also used ; to delmit commands,
   PCF took the ; to indicate a new complete command, so what
   TSO TEST eventually saw was the truncated AT command
   followed by the commands.

Something better was needed.

At least in concept, XI is very simple.

XI TSO command\TSO command\...\TSO command

The commands are separated by the \ character, but many other
characters can be used.  You specify the alternate separator
character by inserting it just before the first TSO command.

XI #TSO command#TSO command

or even XI ;TSO command;TSO command

Why the \ character?  It was close to the 3270 "Field Mark" key,
and existed on most, if not all, teleprinter (e.g. the IBM 2741)
keyboards, so it could be used across terminals.  Finally, it was
rarely, if ever, used in TSO commands.

xi e xitest da new\s\del *\end s
 e xitest da new
 INPUT
 00010
 00020
 s
 del *
 NO LINES IN DATA SET
 end s
 SAVED, DATA SET IS EMPTY
 READY

This XI command is a quick and dirty way to initialize a small
empty data set.  The DCB reflects 1972 attitudes about data set
attributes, but it's not THAT bad.  What actually happened?  The
old line mode EDIT command determined userid.XITEST.DATA did not
exist and prompted the terminal operator for input.  The terminal
operator entered a blank for line 00010 and nothing for line
00020.  This caused EDIT to continue executing the commands; it
saved the one line data set, deleted the one line and saved an
empty data set.

There is no practical limit in XI about the size of the command
buffer it can build; the only limit is in the TMP about the
maximum size of the command buffer the TSO GETLINE service can
handle.

                    H O W   D O E S   X I   W O R K ?

XI does not parse the commands and run the command as a
subroutine.  Rather, it uses the TSO STACK macro to pass the
commands in a command buffer for the Terminal Monitor Program or
command processor to execute after the XI command terminates.
In other words, it is a simplistic CLIST precessor.

The intent of the installation is to prepare a library,
userid.XI.LOAD from the object "deck" and Binder control
statements in this data set.

Batch -

//PREP    EXEC PGM=IEFBR14
//SYSLMOD  DD  DISP=(MOD,DELETE),UNIT=SYSALLDA,SPACE=(TRK,0),
//             DSN=&SYSUID..XI.LOAD

//SYSLIN   DD  DISP=SHR,hlq.XI.CBT.PDS(OBJECT)
//         DD  DISP=SHR,VOL=REF=*.SYSLIN,DSN=hlq.XI.CBT.PDS(LINK)

TSO -

DELETE XI.LOAD
LINK ('hlq.XI.CBT.PDS(OBJECT)' 'hlq.XI.CBT.PDS(LINK)') RENT REFR REUS
LOAD(XI)

If you plan to install XI into a library with other programs,
remove the PREP step and update the DD statement with DD name
SYSLMOD to specify the correct library in the LINK step; or if
you are using the TSO commands, remove the DELETE command and
alter LOAD(XI) in the LINK command to specify the correct
library.

Make the library containing the XI load module availlable to your
TSO session using the TSOLIB command or an equivalent facility.

TSOLIB ACT DA(XI.LOAD)

There are three XI commands.

                              Allow prompting for
             Echo             missing or invalid

XIN          No               No
XINP         Yes              No

                        I N S T A L L I N G   X I

You can install XI in any convenient link list library, or in
MLPA or the LPA.  The XI load module is very small, and normally
loads above the 16 meg line.
