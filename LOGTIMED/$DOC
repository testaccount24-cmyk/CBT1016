LOGTIMED - Source for the LOGTIMED program
MINIFMT  - Source for the MINIFMT tool used by LOGTIMED
PREP     - JCL to assemble and link LOGTIMED, MINIFMT and SMFETIME
SMFETIME - Source for the SMFETIME program used by LOGTIMED

The PREP JCL should run in any z/OS or recent OS/390 system.  Add
a JOB JCL statement, and alter hlq.LOGTIMED.CBT.PDS to specify
this data set.  It deletes and reallocates userid.LOGTIMED.LOAD.
If you choose to link LOGTIMED into a data set with other
programs, remove the PREP step and alter the DD statement with DD
nane SYSLMOD in the LINK step to specify the library you wish to
use.

                     T E S T I N G   L O G T I M E D

Make the userid.LOGTIMED.LOAD data set available to your TSO
session using the TSOLIB command or any other equivalent dynamic
STEPLIB tool, and enter the LOGTIMED command.

                  I N S T A L L I N G   L O G T I M E D

Copy the contents of the userid.LOGTIMED.LOAD data set to any convenient
link list data set.  It can also be installed into LPA or MLPA.
