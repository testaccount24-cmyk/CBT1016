This note is from Sam Golob.   April 21, 2024

I added the JCL to assemble and linkedit KEEPITUP, and I copied the
three modules, MINIFMT, WEEKDAY, and SMFETIME after the main module
KEEPITUP.  They now assemble in batch, using the JCL member KEEPITU$.

I'm not sure that Steve Myers is still alive.  I haven't been able
to contact him.  If anyone has definite news about him, please let
me know.  sbgolob@cbttape.org  845-731-9031
