KEEPITUP keeps a TSO session alive even if there is no terminal
activity.  While KEEPITUP is running, the keyboard is "locked" so
that messages entered using, SEND 'text' USER(your userid) or the
equivalent operator SEND command will display on your terminal.

Many installations discourage, or even forbid, the use of tools
like KEEPITUP, so check with your management before installing or
using KEEPITUP.

The primary advantage of using KEEPITUP is that an analyst
responsible for analyzing system problems can very often regain
use of their TSO session by attentioning out of KEEPITUP even if
it is not possible to logon to the system.

KEEPITUP command syntax -

KEEPITUP  MAXWAIT('maximum wait time, in minutes')
          INTERVAL('time between screen updates, in minutes')
          LONGHEADER/LONGHDR/LH

Defaults - MAXWAIT(5)  INTERVAL(60)

MAXWAIT specifies the maximum number of minutes KEEPITUP will
wait at one time.  It cannot be greater than the SMF JWT value,
for obvious reasons.

INTERVAL specifies the number of minutes between KEEPITUP screen
updates.  The value you specify must be divisible for 24 hours.
1440/60 does not produce a remainder so it is valid; 1440/65
produces a remainder, so KEEPITUP will reject the value and
prompt the terminal operator for a valid value,

LONGHEADER, LONGHDR and LH are aliases of the same concept; KEEPITUP
writes a longer heading line.  The longer heading displays the values
specified for MAXWAIT and INTERVAL.

KEEPITUP clears the screen and displays a header line -

KEEPITUP RUNNING FOR SMYERS STARTED AT  1:19 PM ON WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 1

On its initial entry, KEEPITUP displays its header line and a
detail line -

KEEPITUP RUNNING FOR SMYERS STARTED AT  1:19 PM ON WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 1
IT IS WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 2021  1:19:23 PM (21.258) 1 D 1 H 35 M 5S

The detail line is repeated every INTERVAL minutes, on the interval
time, so, using this as as an example, with the default INTERVAL
time, KEEPITUP will display the next detail line at 2:00:00 PM and
so on.

The 1 D 1 H 25 M 5 S is the time the TSO user has been logged in;
1 day, 1 hour, 25 minutes, 5 seconds.

KEEPITUP was designed to clear the screen, repeat the header line,
and display the next detail line when the screen filled up, but
this does not seem to work.

When it starts, KEEPITUP runs a TSO command called CLRSCRN.
CLRSCRN is provided as part of ISPF.

The batch JCL or TSO commands that follow will prepare the
KEEPITUP load module in userid.KEEPITUP.LOAD.
hlq.KEEPITUP.CBT.PDS refers to this data set.

Batch --
//PREP    EXEC PGM=IEFBR14
//SYSLMOD  DD  DISP=(MODS,DELETE),UNIT=SYSALLDA,SPACE=(TRK,0),
//             DSN=&SYSUID..KEEPITUP.LOAD

TSO --
DELETE KEEPITUP.LOAD
LINK ('hlq.KEEPITUP.CBT.PDS(OBJECT)' 'hlq.KEEPITUP.CBT.PDS(LINK)')
  RENT REFR REUS LOAD(KEEPITUP)

Enter the LINK command as a long string at the TSO READY prompt
or in the ISPF Command Shell, usually option 6 in the ISPF
Primary Options menu.

Make the KEEPITUP command available to your TSO session using
TSOLIB or any dynmic STEPLIB facility available to you:

TSOLIB ACTIVE DATASET(KEEPITUP.LOAD)

Enter the KEEPITUP command

KEEPITUP INTERVAL(1)

KEEPITUP will clear your screen and display the header line and
the first status line.  It will repeat the status line every
minute, on the minute.  You can exit KEEPITUP by entering an
attention as defined by your terminal emulator program: the Esc
key is the most common attention key, though your terminal
emulator may be different.

You can install KEEPITUP in any convenient link list library.  It
can also be installed in MLPA or LPA.
