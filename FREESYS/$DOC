The FREESYS TSO command frees all allocations with DD name
SYSnnnnn, where nnnnn is 5 digits.  Many TSO commands allocate
data sets and request the system to assign a DD name for the
allocation.  These allocations are assigned DD name SYSnnnnn.
Some processors never bother to free the allocation; the LINK and
LOADGO commands are particularly bad in this regard.  FREESYS
examines the allocations as defined in the TIOT.  Each allocation
must pass several tests:

- The DD name must be SYSnnnnn
- The allocation must not be part of a concatenation
- The DD name must not be open in any task in the TSO session

FREESYS was written as a TSO command processor.  It can be used
as though it were a batch program, though this has not been
formally tested.

The JCL or TSO statements that follow prepare a data set
userid.FREESYS.LOAD.  Data set hlq.FREESYS.CBT.PDS represents
this data set.

Batch -

//PREP    EXEC PGM=IEFBR14
//SYSLMOD  DD  DISP=(MOD,DELETE),UNIT=SYSALLDA,SPACE=(TRK,0),
//             DSN=&SYSUID..FREESYS.LOAD
//LINK    EXEC PGM=IEWL,PARM='MAP,XREF,LIST,RENT,REFR,REUS'
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//SYSLMOD  DD  DISP=(NEW,CATLG),UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(TRK,(1,1,1)),
//             DSN=*.PREP.SYSLMOD
//SYSLIN   DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=hlq.FREESYS.CBT.PDS(OBJECT)
//         DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=hlq.FREESYS.CBT.PDS(LINK)

TSO --

DELETE FREESYS.LOAD
LINK ('hlq.FREESYS.CBT.PDS(OBJECT)' 'hlq.FREESYS.CBT.PDS(LINK)')
RENT REFR REUS LOAD(FREESYS)

If you want to install FREESYS in a library with other programs,
remove the PREP step in the batch JCL, and update the DD
statement with DD name SYSLMOD to specify the library you want to
use.  Similarly, for TSO, remove the DELETE command and change
LOAD(FREESYS) in the LINK command to specify the library where
you want to install FREESYS.

                  T E S T I N G   F R E E S Y S

Make the library where you installed FREESYS available to your
TSO session using the TSOLIB or some equivalent facility.

TSOLIB ACT DATASET(FREESYS.LOAD)

Then enter the FREESYS command.  FREESYS will issue messages
showing the DD names it unallocated.  If z/OS dynamic allocation
encounterd a problem, FREESYS will issue appropriate messages.

FREESYS can be installed in any convenient LINKLIST library or in
MLPA or LPA by copying the FREESYS load module to the appropriate
library.  FREESYS is very small and loads above the 16 meg line
so it will have no impact on below the line storage.
