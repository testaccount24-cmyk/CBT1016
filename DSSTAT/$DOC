The TSO DSSTAT command is very loosely modeled on the IBM LISTDS
command, but it provides more useful output.  For example -

listd load
 SMYERS.LOAD
 --RECFM-LRECL-BLKSIZE-DSORG
   U     **    32760   PO
 --VOLUMES--
   CBT004
 READY
dsstat load
 SMYERS.LOAD
 --UNIT---DEVICE---VOLUME--RECFM--LRECL--BLKSIZE--DSORG--ALLOCATED--USED
   5103   3390     CBT004  U          0   32760    PO        110      83
 --ALLOCATED--LAST USED---EXPIRES--ALTERED
    05/01/21  06/27/21     ------    YES
 READY

Like the LISTD command, DSSTAT can produce a memnber list that is
similar to the member list from the LISTD command.  The SQUISH
option in the command directs DSSTAT to produce the member list
in a compacted format.

Command Syntax -

DSSTAT 'dslist'  MEMBER/DIRSTAT/DS  LABEL  SQUISH  RECALL/NORECALL
    EXTENTS VOLUME('volume')

  Required - 'dslist'
  Default - NORECALL

 'dslist' -- One or more data set names for the DSSTAT command to
 process.  You can specify a member name in the data set name:
 DSSTAT will display ISPF directory statitistics for the
 member if statistics are present, otherwise DSSTAT will dump the
 user data for the member in a hexadecimal format similar to the
 output from the IEHLIST LISTPDS command.

 MEMBER - List the members in partitioned data sets.  In addition
 to the member list, DSSTAT produces a summary of the directory as
 described in the DIRSTAT option.

 DIRSTAT /DS - List directory statristics for partitioned data sets
    without a member list.  For example -

    DIRECTORY BLOCKS: 51 ALLOCATED, 47 USED
    292 DIRECTORY ENTRIES, 48 ALIAS ENTRIES

 LABEL - List the data areas in the Format 1, Format 2 and
    Format 3 DSCBs in a hexadecimal dump format.  The output
    is similar to the LISTDS output, however the data is grouped
    in fields that fully recognize the Format 1 DSCB changes
    IBM made in support of System Managed Srorage.

 SQUISH - List the member list from the MEMBER option in a compacted
    format.

 RECALL - Direct allocation to recall data sets archived by
    storage management tools like HSM.

 NORECALL - Do not recall data sets archived by storage
    management tools like HSM.

 EXTENTS - List detailed information about the disk extents
    assigned to the data set.  For example -

    ---NO--RELTRK--START CCHH--END CCHH--TRACKS
        1   00000   019F0007   019F0008       2
        2   00002   019F0009   019F0009       1
        3   00003   021D000E   021D000E       1

   This data set has three extents: the first extent has 2 tracks,
   the other two extents have one track.  Reltrk is calculated by
   DSSTAT and represents the relative track for the first track in
   the extent.

 VOLUME('vvvvvv') - Specify the volume where the data is located.
   The volume is ignored if the data set is cataloged on an SMS
   managed volume.

In this section, hlq.DSSTAT.CBT.PDS represents the data set name
assigned to this data set: replace hlq.DSSTAT.CBT.PDS with the
actual data set name you assigned to this data set.
hlq.DSSTAT.LOAD represents the data set name assigned to the data
set where a test load module for DSSTAT will be created.  In the
JCL, hlq will be considered to be your userid.

Batch --

//PREP    EXEC PGM=IEFBR14
//SYSLMOD  DD  DISP=(MOD,DELETE),UNIT=SYSALLDA,SPACE=(TRK,0),
//             DSN=&SYSUID..DSSTAT.LOAD
//LINK    EXEC PGM=IEWL,PARM='RENT,REFR REUS,LIST,MAP'
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//SYSUT1   DD  UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,(1,1))
//SYSLMOD  DD  DISP=(,CATLG),UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(TRK,(1,1,1)),
//             DSN=*.PREP.SYSLMOD
//SYSLIN   DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=hlq.DSSTAT.CBT.PDS(OBJECT)
//         DD  DISP=SHR,VOL=REF=*.SYSLIN,
//             DSN=hlq.DSSTAT.CBT.PDS(LINK)

Obviously, if your actual data set is a data set containing other
programs, delete the PREP step and alter the DD statement with DD
name SYSLMOD in the LINK  step to meet your requirements.

TSO --

At the TSO READY prompt or ISPF Option 6,
enter this TSO command on one line.

LINK ('hlq.DSSTAT.CBT.PDS(OBJECT)' 'hlq.DSSTAT.CBT.PDS(LINK)')
LOAD(DSSTAT) RENT REFR REUS

The LINK command will create the DSSTAT load module in data set
userid.DSSTAT.LOAD.

                       T e s t i n g   D S S T A T

After you have prepared the DSSTAT load module you can make it
available to your TSO session by using the TSOLIB command or any
alternate facility.

TSOLIB ACT DATASET(DSSTAT.LOAD)
DSSTAT DSSTAT.LOAD member

                    I n s t a l l i n g   D S S T A T

You can install DSSTAT in any library in your link list.  You can
also install it in your MLPA or LPA.

Volumes with extended attribute data sets are not supported.

Used tracks for PDS-E data sets represent an estimate based on
allocated and used blocks in the data set.  This estimate is
usually a little low by one or two tracks; however it can serve
as an estimate to allocate a replacement data set.  ISPF data set
attributes list this as a percentage; used tracks is much more
useful.

DSSTAT data set information displays allocated and used space in
track units regardless of the original allocation specification,
e.g. blocks or cylinders.  In addition, it is possible to fool
ISPF data set information into displaying cylinder allocated
space incorrectly.
