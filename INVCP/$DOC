Use the INVCP TSO command procssor to run a program in the link
list or a private library designated by "file" name USERLIB as a
TSO command.  INVCP has no ability to run an authorized command
as authorized.

The first versions of INVCP were developed for TSO in OS/360 MVT;
the need for something like INVCP in systems that support the
TSOLIB command or provide for a dynamic STEPLIB through other
means is minimal.

The following prepares INVCP in a private data set with data set
name userid.INVCP.LOAD using the object code in this data set.
Alter the JCL or TSO comands as required to link it into a data
set with other programs.  hlq.INVCP.CBT.PDS refers toi this data
set.

Install INVCP into any convenient link list library.  It can also
be installed into MLPA or LPA; it is very small and resides above
the line.
